You are a senior software architect analyzing a development task.

Your role is to produce a clear, actionable SPEC.md document that:
1. Clearly states the problem being solved
2. Lists concrete requirements (functional and non-functional)
3. Identifies constraints and dependencies
4. Defines measurable success criteria
5. Explicitly states what is out of scope

WORKSPACE RULES:
- Follow the coding standards and conventions provided in the workspace context
- PEP 8, type hints on all signatures, comprehensive docstrings
- Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables
- Structured logging with correlation IDs

LEARNING FROM PAST MISTAKES:
If the context contains a "Lessons from Previous Tasks" section, review it
carefully. These are documented failure patterns from earlier agent attempts.
Avoid repeating these mistakes — they represent real production bugs.

Be specific and actionable. Avoid vague requirements.
Focus on WHAT needs to be done, not HOW (that comes in design phase).
Output ONLY the markdown document — no commentary, no fences.

## Task
# Task: Create project scaffolding and base files

Priority: 1
Status: spec-in-progress
Created: 2026-02-28T01:00:00Z
Scope: src/, tests/, config/, assets/, scripts/, docs/, voices/, models/, working/, archive/, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, .gitignore, .env.example, README.md

## Description

Create the full directory structure and base files for the viral_channel project.
This includes all empty __init__.py files, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt,
.gitignore, .env.example, and a RE

## Problem Statement
The task involves setting up the foundational directory structure and essential base files for the viral_channel project. This includes creating necessary directories, Python package structures, placeholder files with docstrings, and configuration files such as pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, .gitignore, .env.example, and README.md.

## Functional Requirements

1. **FR-1: Directory Structure Creation**
   - Create all specified directories and subdirectories as outlined in the directory structure section.
   
2. **FR-2: Python Package Initialization**
   - Ensure every directory designated as a Python package contains an `__init__.py` file with an appropriate module docstring.

3. **FR-3: Project Metadata Configuration**
   - Generate `pyproject.toml` with correct project metadata including name, version, description, and Python version requirements.

4. **FR-4: Dependency Management**
   - Create `requirements.txt` listing all necessary dependencies with major versions pinned as specified.

5. **FR-5: Version Control Setup**
   - Develop `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control.

6. **FR-6: Environment Configuration**
   - Formulate `.env.example` containing placeholder entries for all required environment variables.

7. **FR-7: Documentation Initialization**
   - Draft `README.md` with project title, one-line description, references to `SPEC.md` and `DESIGN.md`, and basic setup instructions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR-1: Maintainability**
   - The directory structure should be organized in a way that facilitates easy navigation and future expansion.

2. **NFR-2: Code Quality Standards**
   - Adhere to PEP 8 coding standards, include type hints for all function signatures, and provide comprehensive docstrings for each module.

3. **NFR-3: Logging Practices**
   - Implement structured logging with correlation IDs as per workspace rules.

4. **NFR-4: Security Best Practices**
   - Avoid hardcoding secrets; use environment variables instead.

## Constraints

1. **C-1: Excluded Files**
   - Do not create `config/config.yaml` as it is a separate task.

2. **C-2: Content Restrictions**
   - No emojis should be present in any file content.

3. **C-3: Dependency Versioning**
   - Pin major versions only in `requirements.txt`.

4. **C-4: Placeholder Files**
   - Ensure all placeholder `.py` files contain only a module docstring and no functional code.

5. **C-5: Empty Directories**
   - Use `.gitkeep` files for empty directories to ensure they are tracked by Git.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All specified directories and subdirectories have been created.
- [ ] Every Python package directory contains an `__init__.py` file with the correct docstring.
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` includes accurate project metadata and Python version requirements.
- [ ] `requirements.txt` lists all dependencies with major versions pinned as specified.
- [ ] `.gitignore` correctly excludes necessary files and directories from version control.
- [ ] `.env.example` contains placeholder entries for all required environment variables.
- [ ] `README.md` includes the project title, one-line description, references to documentation files, and setup instructions.

## Out of Scope

1. **OOS-1: Functional Code Implementation**
   - Writing any functional Python code beyond creating placeholders is out of scope.

2. **OOS-2: Configuration File Creation**
   - Creating `config/config.yaml` is a separate task and should not be addressed here.

3. **OOS-3: Test Cases Development**
   - Developing test cases or writing any test code is outside the scope of this task.

4. **OOS-4: Feature Implementation**
   - Implementing any features or functionality beyond setting up the project structure is out of scope.

5. **OOS-5: CI/CD Setup**
   - Configuring continuous integration and deployment pipelines is not part of this task.

## Open Questions

1. **Q-1: Video/Audio Processing Tools**
   - Should specific video/audio processing tools (e.g., FFmpeg) be included in the initial setup, or are they to be added later?

2. **Q-2: Additional Dependencies**
   - Are there any additional dependencies not listed in `requirements.txt` that should be included for the base setup?
