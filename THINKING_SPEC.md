You are a senior software architect analyzing a development task.

Your role is to produce a clear, actionable SPEC.md document that:
1. Clearly states the problem being solved
2. Lists concrete requirements (functional and non-functional)
3. Identifies constraints and dependencies
4. Defines measurable success criteria
5. Explicitly states what is out of scope

WORKSPACE RULES:
- Follow the coding standards and conventions provided in the workspace context
- PEP 8, type hints on all signatures, comprehensive docstrings
- Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables
- Structured logging with correlation IDs

LEARNING FROM PAST MISTAKES:
If the context contains a "Lessons from Previous Tasks" section, review it
carefully. These are documented failure patterns from earlier agent attempts.
Avoid repeating these mistakes — they represent real production bugs.

Be specific and actionable. Avoid vague requirements.
Focus on WHAT needs to be done, not HOW (that comes in design phase).
Output ONLY the markdown document — no commentary, no fences.

## Task
# Task: Implement viral score calculation module

Priority: 3
Status: spec-in-progress
Created: 2026-02-28T02:07:00Z
Depends-On: agent/task-20260228020100-fix-conftest-imports
Scope: src/discovery/scorer.py, tests/test_scorer.py

## Description
Implement the viral scoring algorithm from SPEC.md Section 4.1.

Create src/discovery/scorer.py:
- ViralScorer class initialized with scoring weights from config
- calculate_score(video_data: dict) -> float
  Computes: w1*view_velocity + w2*reddit

## Problem Statement

The goal is to implement a viral score calculation module that evaluates YouTube videos based on their potential to go viral. The score is computed using a weighted sum of several normalized metrics: view velocity, Reddit score, like ratio, comment velocity, and recency factor.

## Functional Requirements

1. **FR-1**: Implement the `ViralScorer` class in `src/discovery/scorer.py`.
2. **FR-2**: The `ViralScorer` class must be initialized with scoring weights from the configuration.
3. **FR-3**: Implement the `calculate_score` method that computes the weighted sum of normalized metrics.
4. **FR-4**: Normalize each metric to a 0-1 range before applying weights.
5. **FR-5**: Implement normalization functions for view velocity, Reddit score, comment velocity, and recency factor.
6. **FR-6**: Calculate the like ratio as (likes / views) and normalize it.
7. **FR-7**: Ensure that videos with zero views, likes, or comments receive a score of 0.0 without errors.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR-1**: The module must handle large datasets efficiently.
2. **NFR-2**: The scoring algorithm must be reliable and not crash on unexpected input.
3. **NFR-3**: The code must be maintainable, with clear separation of concerns.
4. **NFR-4**: The module must adhere to security best practices.

## Constraints

1. **C-1**: All weights must sum exactly to 1.0.
2. **C-2**: Division by zero must be handled gracefully.
3. **C-3**: Recency factor decay must use exponential, not linear, scaling.
4. **C-4**: No emojis may appear in logs or outputs.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All normalization functions return values between 0.0 and 1.0.
- [ ] Weights are correctly loaded from the configuration.
- [ ] The calculated score is within the range of 0.0 to 1.0.
- [ ] Videos with zero views, likes, or comments receive a score of 0.0 without errors.
- [ ] Comprehensive tests cover all normalization functions and edge cases.

## Out of Scope

- Data fetching from YouTube or Reddit APIs.
- Video storage or processing.
- Displaying scores in a user interface.
- Configuration validation beyond ensuring weights sum to 1.0.

## Open Questions

- How should extremely large values be handled during normalization?
- What is the default ceiling for view velocity normalization?
- Should the recency factor decay curve be configurable?
